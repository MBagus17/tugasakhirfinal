                <h4>Network Administrator</h4>
                <p>network administrator is a person designated in an organization whose responsibility includes maintaining 
                    computer infrastructures with emphasis on local area networks (LANs) up to wide area networks (WANs).
                    Responsibilities may vary between organizations, but installing new hardware, on-site servers, 
                    enforcing licensing agreements, software-network interactions as well as network integrity and resilience
                    are some of the key areas of focus. <br><br>

                    Network administrators are responsible for making sure that computer hardware and network infrastructure related
                    to an organization's data network are effectively maintained. In smaller organizations, they are typically involved
                    in the procurement of new hardware, the rollout of new software, maintaining disk images for new computer installs,
                    making sure that licenses are paid for and up to date for software that needs it, maintaining the standards for server
                    installations and applications, monitoring the performance of the network, checking for security breaches, and poor data
                    management practices. A common question for the small-medium business (SMB) network administrator is, how much 
                    bandwidth do I need to run my business? Typically, within a larger organization, these roles are split into multiple
                    roles or functions across various divisions and are not actioned by the one individual. In other organizations,
                    some of these roles mentioned are carried out by system administrators.<br><br>
                    
                    As with many technical roles, network administrator positions require a breadth of technical knowledge and the ability
                    to learn the intricacies of new networking and server software packages quickly. Within smaller organizations, the more
                    senior role of network engineer is sometimes attached to the responsibilities of the network administrator. It is common
                    for smaller organizations to outsource this function.</p>
